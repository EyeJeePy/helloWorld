# Personal Protfolio
* *Beginner project - HTML and CSS*

This is the last project to get my first [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-projects) certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Installation
[**This**](https://download-directory.github.io/) app can help you download a .zip file of the code, just copy and paste the main directory's URL there and press Enter. 

Then, extract the files in your folder of choice and open the **index.html** file, this should run the application in your default browser.
