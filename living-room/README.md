This is a simple JavaScript project where a video is played within a modal over an ambient background just for fun.

Learning with [**John Smilga**'s](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects) ideas.

## Installation
[**This**](https://download-directory.github.io/) app can help you download a .zip file of the code, just copy and paste the main directory's URL there and press Enter. 

Then, extract the files in your folder of choice and open the **index.html** file, this should run the application in your default browser.
